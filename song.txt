Yeah, I'm a trooper, yeah, with a lot of bands
Y'all be cappin' online, on the Instagram
All my diamonds Michael Jackson, watch they dance they heads off
I'm the captain of this boat, give me ya' money, you gettin' off

All that startin' to sound the same, yeah, your shit is gettin' old
Where your money? Where your bitches? Yeah, you a joke (Ha)
